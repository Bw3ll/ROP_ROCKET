This new, advanced ROP framwork made it debute at at DEF CON 31 with some unprecedented capabilities. ROCKET generates several types of chains, and it provides new patterns or techniques.

Please note that this is still a work in progress, with some updated and enhanced capabilities to be added. Updates should be frequent in the next couple months. If you encounter issues, please put them on issues or email me with them, and I will get them sorted.

# Install Instructions
